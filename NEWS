New in 0.9.11
=============

== Libraries ==

=== lifepoly ===

 * now Lagrange polynomials can be instantiated using only
   Lagrange<Order,Scalar|Vectorial>

=== lifediscr ===

 * Simplified FunctionSpace<>

 * Bdf: allow to set time step and final time, added setSteady() to
   set time step and final time to a very big value for the
   computation of the steady state

 * support for high order nodal basis function in case of periodic
   conditions in 1D and 2D is complete see #20

=== lifealg ===

 * Improve robustness of linear algebra backends see #21

=== lifefilters ===

 * Simplfy Exporter interface, old interface still supported, but
   might be obsoleted in a future release. The simplification is that
   the TimeSet data structure should not be used directly but through
   the Exporter class interface.

=== lifevf ===

 * reflect simplifications made in lifepoly and lifediscr

 * mat(),vec(): supports for trial and test functions added, now you
   can write vec(0.,idt(v)).

== Applications ==

=== Polyvis ===

 * resurrected a tool to visualize polynomial set called polyvis


New in 0.9.10
=============

== Libraries ==

=== lifediscr ===

 * started support for high order nodal basis function in case of periodic
   conditions

=== lifefilters ===

 * Gmsh : throw an exception if gmsh is execute when not available

== Documentation ==

=== Tutorial ===

 * updated the building section

 * updated the Backend<> section

 * started new examples (nonlinear pde)

== Build System ==

=== Configure ===

 * better feedback to users

 * a summary text file provides what is available and what is not

=== Gmsh ===

 * configure: better support




New in 0.9.9
============

* If Petsc is supported then use Petsc as default backend.

* Slepc(Petsc) support has been updated to latest version.

* Added periodic boundary conditions support in FunctionSpace<>.

* New Build system framework still using the Autotools: the Life
  Developement Plateform (LDP).
   - split the directories into submodules which can hold extra (external
     to life) modules: examples, benchmarks, doc, applications, research
   - allow for easy creation of new projets which can build on top of the
     LDP.

* [Experimental] System<FunctionSpaceType> framework implementation.

* [Experimental] Shell matrices (only support matrix/vector
  multiplication) support.
