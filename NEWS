New in 1.0.0 Prerelease 2
=========================

* Added access to second order derivatives in the language feel++. The
  keywords hess(), hesst() and hessv() have been introduced and behave
  the same way as the other operators (e.g. grad(),...). Note the
  restriction that the second order derivatives are implemented only
  for the linear geometric mapping(i.e works only for linear
  simplices). Quadratic geometric mappings would require the
  computation of an additional term.

* Fixed the construction of the mesh and related data structures in
  parallel: implementation of a new algorithm which should also prove
  helpful when parallelising the dof table creation.

* New class GmshSimplexDomain<Dim,Order> generates gmsh mesh for
  simplices domain. It works like
  GmshTensorizeDomain<Dim,Order,Entity>. The class Gmsh offers now a
  factory to generate from a string either a GmshSimplexDomain<> or a
  GmshTensorizeDomain<>.
