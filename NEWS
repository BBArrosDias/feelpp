New in 0.9.9
============

* If Petsc is supported then use Petsc as default backend.

* Slepc(Petsc) support has been updated to latest version.

* Added periodic boundary conditions support in FunctionSpace<>.

* New Build system framework still using the Autotools: the Life
  Developement Plateform (LDP).
   - split the directories into submodules which can hold extra (external
     to life) modules: examples, benchmarks, doc, applications, research
   - allow for easy creation of new projets which can build on top of the
     LDP.

* [Experimental] System<FunctionSpaceType> framework implementation.

* [Experimental] Shell matrices (only support matrix/vector
  multiplication) support.
