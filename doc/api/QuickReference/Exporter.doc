\section Introduction Introduction

Once we have solved the PDE is solved we usually would like to
visualise the solution and possibly other data or fields associated
with the problem. Feel++ provides a very powerful framework for
post-processing allowing to:
 - visualize time-based data
 - visualize high order functions
 - visualize traces
 - use standard visualisation tools such as Paraview, Ensight and even Gmsh

To achieve this, Feel++ defines a so-called \c Exporter object

\section Visualisation Visualisation

We would like to visualise the function \f$u=\sin(\pi x)\f$ over
\f$\Omega=\{(x,y) \in \mathbb{R}^2 | x^2 + y^2 < 1\}\f$. \f$\Omega\f$
is approximated by \f$\Omega_h\f$.

To define \f$\Omega\f$ and \f$u\f$, the code reads
\snippet myexporter.cpp Def_Omega_u

We start with an \c Exporter object that allows to visualise the \f$P_1\f$ interpolant of \f$u\f$ over
