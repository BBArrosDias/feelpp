# Laplacian examples

## Harmonic extension

`feelpp_doc_harmonic` is a program showing how to solve for the harmonic
extension of e.g. a displacement given at a boundary of a domain

## Polar coordinate system

Two examples are available to solve the Laplacian in two coordinate systems (cartesian and polar) having the same solution.

 * `feelpp_doc_laplacian_polar` polar coodinate system
 * `feelpp_doc_laplacian_cartesian` cartesian coodinate system

The default arguments(and configuration) should work seamlessly.


## Laplacian with holes

`feelpp_doc_laplacian_with_holes` solves for the laplacian in a domain with a hole.


## Discontinuous Galerkin

`feelpp_doc_laplacian_dg` solves for the Laplacian in a square using a modal
basis (Dubiner) using a DG formulation.

## Periodic boundary condition

`feelpp_doc_laplacian_periodic` solves for the Laplacian in a square
with periodic boundary conditions.
