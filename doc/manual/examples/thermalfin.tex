This problem considers the performance of a heat sink designed for the thermal management of high-density electronic components. The heat sink is comprised of a base/spreader which in turn supports a number of plate fins exposed to flowing air. We model the flowing air through a simple convection heat transfer coefficient. From the engineering point of view, this Problem illustrates the application of conduction analysis to an important class of cooling problems: electronic components and systems. \\ \\
Our interest is in the conduction temperature distribution at the base of the spreader. The target is to study how the heat transfer occures with different parameters on our heat sink. The heat generated by high-density electronic components is such that it's very expensive to cool large structures (data center). The cooling optimization is consequent in the run for decreasing operating costs.

\section{Problem description}
\subsection{Domain}

We consider here a classical "radiator" which is a CPU heat sink. Those types of coolers are composed with a certain number of plate fins exposed to flowing air or exposed to a ventilator. Regarding the periodicity and geometry of our concern, we can make our study on a characteristic element of the problem : a half cell of the heat sink single thermal fin with its spreader at the basis. Let's take a look at the geometry of our problem :

\end{figure}

Our study is avaible in 2 or 3 dimensions, depending on the application's parameters. You'll see later how to work with it. Let's see on which meshes we are working on (draws are have been made with a mesh size \lstinline!hsize = 0.5!)  :

\end{figure}

We consider the physical domain $\varOmega (\mu)$ where $\mu = (\mu_1, ...,\mu_p)$ represents the parameters of our concern. 

\subsection{Parameters}
The implementation of thoses parameters are described in ~\ref{therm:param}.

\subsubsection{Biot number}
The Biot number $Bi$ is a dimensionless number used in non-steady or transient states in heat transfer calculations. It gives a simple index of the ratio of the heat transfer resistances inside  and at the surface of a body. This number determines wheter or not the temperatures insdide a body will significantly vary in space while the body heats or cools over time from a thermal gradient applied to its surface. This number is defined as 
\begin{equation}
Bi = \frac{hL_c}{k_b}
\end{equation} 
where $h$ is the heat transfert coefficient, $L_c$ is the characteristic length (commonly defined as the volume of the body divided by the surface area) and $k_b$ is the thermal conductivity of the body (here the body is the thermal fin) and is expressed in $Wm^{-1}K^{-1}$. This number has to be between $0$ and $1$, this condition is included in the parameters described in ~\ref{therm:param}. This conductivity is typically one of the parameters we are insterested in to modify. This parameter corresponds to the material choosen for the heat sink. Here is a small array for the well-known metals :
\begin{center}
\begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
  \hline
  Material & Thermal conductivity (293 K)\\
  \hline
  \hline
  Aluminium & 0.1 \\
  \hline
  Bronze & 26 \\
  \hline
  Copper & 386 \\
  \hline
  Gold & 314 \\
  \hline
  Silver & 406 \\
  \hline
\end{tabular}
\end{center}

\subsubsection{Material}

Here the material parameter can be described with the spreader-to-fin conductivity ratio $\kappa$. This ratio is expressed as
\begin{equation*}
\displaystyle{\kappa = \frac{\tilde{\kappa}_{sp}}{\tilde{\kappa}_{fin}}}
\end{equation*}
where $\tilde{\kappa}_{sp}$ and $\tilde{\kappa}_{fin}$ are the thermal conductivities of the spreader and the fin. In that way, we make possible the construction of a heat sink with $2$ different materials. As a consequence, if you choose the same material, the ratio will be equal to $1$.

\subsubsection{Spacing}
This parameter represents the length between two plates fin. This parameter finds its place in the periodicity condition, we denote $\lambda$ this length.

\subsubsection{Thickness}
The thickness of a platefin (divided by two here because we are working on a half cell) takes part in the heat diffusion. We call $\gamma$ this parameter.

\subsubsection{Width}

This parameter is to take into account only if you are considering the 3D issue. Typically, this parameter is linked with constructor's standards. This parameter is called \lstinline!depth! in the application's implementation.


\section{Theory and implementation}
\label{therm:equations}

\subsection{Figure}
The following figure describes the parameters and the geometry we are using in the equations to solve our issue :

\caption{Geometry details}
\end{figure}

%\Huge $\varOmega_1 \quad \quad \quad \varOmega_2$

The global domain is $\varOmega = \varOmega_1 \cup \varOmega_2 $ where $\varOmega_1$ is the fin's domain and $\varOmega_2$ the spreader's domain. We note $\partial\varOmega$ the border of the domain $\varOmega$.


\subsection{Equations}

Our concern satisfies the heat equation which reads 
\begin{equation}
   \begin{split}
      \displaystyle{\rho \frac{ \partial T}{\partial t}}  -  \kappa \Delta T & = 0 \\ \\
      \displaystyle{ \kappa \frac{\partial T}{\partial n}} & =  1_{| \varOmega_{base}} \\ \\
      \displaystyle{ \kappa \frac{\partial T}{\partial n}} & = - Bi T_{| \partial \varOmega_1 \backslash \varOmega3 } \\ \\
     Q_{in} & = Q_{out} (periodicity)
  \end{split}
\end{equation}
where $\rho$ is the material's density ($kg.m^{-3}$ in the SI unit), $Bi$ the Biot number and $T$ the temperature at a precise point (in 2D or 3D).

\subsubsection{Steady-state}
Here the steady state can be considered as the standard state because it corresponds to the standard utilisation of the components. This state satisfies the conduction equation.

\subsubsection{Transient states}


\subsection{Boundary conditions}
The problem requieres that the temperature and heat flux are continute on fin or spreader interfaces. Considering the problem's geometry, we also impose zero heat flux on the vertical surfaces of the spreader.
