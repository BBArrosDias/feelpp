 - [ ] integration (1 ou 2 j) [0/6]
   - [ ] CP: integration 2D/3D: the gradients are not properly computed 
         when the function the number of variables is less than the 
         number of components
   - [ ] VC: generate meshes of faces
   - [ ] CP: generate function spaces from meshes of topology d-1

Attention: there are some quadrature points on the simplex which are outside the
reference element.
